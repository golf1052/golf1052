They're also where cars do the most damage and it's demonstrably unhealthy to live near these roads - breathing those emissions literally takes years off of your life, not to mention the risk of getting hit and the noise.

This is a traditional form of urban development and should be easy to achieve with no onerous regulations such as parking standards.

Restricting development in any of these so-called urban neighborhoods will only contribute to further sprawl and rising costs of housing. There's no reason why large apartment buildings shouldn't be going up in all of these urban neighborhoods. Once the density of people increases, the commercial development will follow. It makes no sense to limit housing development of these areas now. They're already so close to business districts by transit, walking, and rolling; it is a heinous hand-out to already wealthy single family homeowners to protect these urban neighborhoods, which are IN the city , from true urban development.
