# Introduction

Hi, my name is Sanders Lauture, coder, lover of pizza, and hopefully your next technical documentation writer. Typically developers do not like writing documentation. They may comment their code but they often rarely provide the higher level technical documentation to accompany the code they've written. Also it is often difficult for developers to write documentation that can be easily understood by people without a technical background. It could be assumed that technical documentation would only need to be read by other people who are technically inclined but other developers may also need technical documentation to learn how software works. A good example of this would be onboarding new developers. New developers will come in with zero experience on how a company's code works. Good technical documentation can mean the difference between days and weeks in how long it takes for a new developer to get up to speed and fully productive.

# Machine Learning and Game Artificial Intelligence

This document asks questions about the current failings with artificial Intelligence in video games and explains how using machine learning to building game AI will produce smarter, fairer, and overall better game AI. This document tries to explain some of the basic concepts of machine learning to gamers; an audience that is assumed to have no familiarity with machine learning and may have little familiarity with how game AI is created.

# The Box

A high level overview behind the design and assembly of a LED hardware project. This document assumes the reader has some familiarity with computer science topics but the document is also fairly casual and should be accessible to people without much software knowledge.

# Mini Textbook on Game Programming

A short textbook on the basics of game programming. The book guides the reader from step 0, setting up their development environment, to creating a simple Pong game.
